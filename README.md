## Analysis

The analysis of Zepto's delivery expenses involved the following steps:

1. Data Preparation: The dataset was cleaned and prepared for analysis. This step included handling missing data, data transformation, and ensuring data quality.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): An initial exploration of the dataset was performed to gain insights into the distribution of expenses, trends, and patterns over time. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and key summary metrics were derived.

3. Time Series Analysis: A time series analysis was conducted to understand how delivery expenses fluctuated over time. This involved visualizing trends, seasonality, and any potential outliers or anomalies in the data.

4. Expense Category Breakdown: The expenses were categorized to understand the composition of costs related to Zepto's delivery operations. This breakdown provided insights into which expense categories had the most significant impact.

5. Visualization: The dataset was visualized using both Tableau and Gephi to create meaningful and insightful visual representations of the data. These visualizations were used to communicate findings effectively.

## Visualizations

Visualizations play a crucial role in conveying insights from the analysis. Here are some of the visualizations created using Tableau and Gephi:

### Tableau Visualizations

- **Time Series Plot**: A line chart depicting the daily delivery expenses over time, highlighting any trends or seasonality.

- **Expense Category Breakdown**: A pie chart illustrating the distribution of expenses across various categories.

- **Geospatial Visualization**: A map showing the geographical distribution of expenses, helping to identify areas with higher expenses.

### Gephi Visualizations

- **Network Graph**: A network graph illustrating the relationships between different expense categories, suppliers, or any other relevant entities. This helps in identifying dependencies and connections within the data.

- **Community Detection**: Clustering analysis to identify groups or communities within the data, which may reveal interesting patterns.
